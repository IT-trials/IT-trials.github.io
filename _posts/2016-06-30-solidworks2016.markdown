The silent installer doesn't work from command line

Forget pdq/sscm/mdt task sequence deployment or make it work yourself.

## Solution:
Read the docs and write a script:

## My Script... so far:

## What I've found:
I think these items are required for network install:

    SERVERLIST="PORT@SERVER" SOLIDWORKSSERIALNUMBER="x"
