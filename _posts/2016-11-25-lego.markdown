## Problem
Create a Silent Installer for Mindstorm EV3 Edu & WeDo.  These packages seem to contain development platforms, drivers and configuration upload utilities for two classes of Lego Controllers.

Mindstorm was so easy it's not worth mentioning but WeDo provided a couple of challenges

## Solution
Mindstorm installs simply using the following command as per installer docs.


    LME-EV3-WIN32-ENGB-01-02-02-full-setup.exe /q /AcceptLicenses yes


WeDo is a little harder.  If fails when using the following  


    WeDo2-Full-Win7-GLOBAL-1-3-23.exe /verysilent /norestart


I found that this was because the main installer triggers another driver installer that throws two UAC confirmation boxes.

I unpacked the main installer using [innounp](http://innounp.sourceforge.net/) and within the extracted files found the following driver installers:  

![]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/images/8/drivers.png)

.\{app}\driver

I cached this directory along with the main installer and deleted the rest

I found that if I installed these drivers first prior to the main installer it completes successfully.

The drivers can be installed silently using the following as documented in the dpinst64.exe /? description


    dpinst64.exe /Q


That's great, a two line batch file will suffice to install this in a few mins per machine.  Don't forget the norestart switch or it will restart every machine post install.  I have a suspicion this may simply delay a restart but that is circumstantial.


#Pitfalls
Post installation the two applications require some local firewall rules.

At the moment I have simply run the applications as admin and select yes when prompted on a few selected machines.

The following rules are then created and could be deployed by group policy or perhaps by powershell if they are widely required
