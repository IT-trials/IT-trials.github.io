This blog hopes to share some of the solutions I land on in the course of my work as an IT Administrator.  I don't intend on doing a lot of tutorials or best practice, just short and simple posts of the form "error message -> solution -> reflection".

I expect most of the content that I submit to be on Microsoft Deployment (MDT), Group Policy and Powershell.  If I can get my coleague to add some content, this might be bolstered.
